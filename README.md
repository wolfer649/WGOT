# World's Greatest Oven (Appliance?) Thermometer
# Overview
This is a standalone Raspberry Pi hardware assembly project and associated software that can be used to measure, chart and record appliance temperatures over time, using a cable-attached thermocouple probe.
# Features
On the the 2.8" PiTFT capacitive touchscreen, this device will show the current temperature, with the option of an additional save/hold temperature value or even a graph of the temperature over time.
The selections are chosen by pressing associated buttons on the PiTFT screen's board and by touching the PiTFT screen.

You can also reset the timer, in case you want to start recording again â€“ say after a false start or changing adjustment values.

It also creates a csv log file that can later be used offline, to build fancy graphs or spreadsheets for analysis purposes. Two older csv log files are saved, so that data is not lost after a reboot

Optionally, this Linux-based device can be shutdown and/or restarted at the touch of a single button, to avoid having to remove and replace the power supply connection.

There is also a handy flashing LED activity indicator, so that you can check if the software is alive: especially useful in "headless" mode.

No Internet connection is required, because all of the timing is relative and typical CPU utilization is less than 10%.

For development purposes, the software can be tested on an attached X11 HDMI screen/keyboard (or via VNC) without access to the PiTFT itself, though you definitely need the Perma-Proto Hat board with the MAX31855 board attached to make it work.
# History
Proto22 was the first beta version.

Proto25 included the following changes.
- Fix the problem of the activity LED being left on after the programme exits
- Save the last two csv log files when the programme is restarted 
- Change the chart line's colour from red to blue if the current temperature is at or below freezing

Proto26 added the following changes.
- Fix the problem with the csv log file not having a time-zero entry
- Documentation was updated as well.

Proto28 added the following changes.
- Fix activity LED not being turned off after keyboard exit, via 'x' key on main display.
- Improve debug messages, if enabled in the code.
- Use Decimal arithmetic for Temperature Adjustment menu, to avoid odd values with binary math.
- Update documentation to show how to log stdout, stderr messages from rc.local.

Proto29 added the following changes.
- Shift screens to the right, to accommodate PiTFT faceplate for Cyntech case.
- Minor fixes to comments and debug code.
# Usage
Follow the instructions in the documentation to build the hardware and to install pre-requisite software.
The following command will execute the programme.
There is also an example rc.local in the documentation that will log runtime messages.

sudo python Proto29.py

or

sudo python3 Proto29.py
# Known Bugs
The activity LED may stay on after the software exits. (Proto22 - 2019-02-24)

The csv log does not include time-zero values at startup or after restart. (Proto25 - 2019-03-08)
- Fixed in Proto26

Code to force the display to the PiTFT display no longer works with Rasbian Stretch with updates if an X11 display is available.
- It still displays OK on the PiTFT when started from rc.local.
- Looking at a workaround for this issue.

Temperature Adjustment menu can show -0.0 instead of 0.0 (Proto28 - 2019-05-01)
- This doesn't cause a problem

Forcetft variable no longer forces the display to the PiTFT if an X11 display is active on Rasbian Stretch (Proto28 - 2019-05-01)
- The PiTFT display still works when it's started from rc.local, even if an HDMI X11 display is attached.
- i.e. It is still possible to run Proto28.py in headless mode, using the PiTFT as the only display.

The activity LED may stop flashing, but the PiTFT buttons still work OK. (Proto29 - 2019-07-03)
- TBD
